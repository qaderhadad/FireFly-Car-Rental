# FireFly-Car-Rental
The Firefly Car Rental Management System is a project for the Database Management System (COMP333) Course at Birzeit University.  The design of the database is based on information that is to be collected, or has been collected in the past. This design is to allow easy data entry, access and querying to the complex entities and data. The driving philosophy behind the database design is to have an efficient database that would be easy to maintain and expand, as well as allow easy data entry and access.
